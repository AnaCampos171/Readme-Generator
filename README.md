# Module 9 Challenge: Readme Generator 

## Description

This project was created for the purpose of quickly generating a README file  for a new project using a command line application(CLI).

## Installation

This project did use starter code from the repository: git@githubcom:coding-boot-camp/potential-enigma.git. 
A new README.md file is generated from a user's input using the [Inquirer package](https://www.npmjs.com/package/inquirer). The application is invoked with the following command:

```
node index.js
```
## Usage

- User is presented with a command line application that accepts user input.
- User is prompted for information about their application repository, and a  professional README.md is generated with the project title and sections entitled Description, Table of Contents, Installation, Usage, License, Contributing, Tests, and Questions  filled in with the user's responses. 
- A user can click on the items in their Table of Contents, and be taken to the corresponding section of their README file.
- This image shows the command line functionality of the application:
